# 💪 BMI Calculator

A sleek and modern **Body Mass Index Calculator** built using Flutter. This project explores how to translate custom UI designs into real Flutter applications using flexible layout techniques and widget customization.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was to push my UI/UX development skills in Flutter. I focused on learning how to design beautiful, functional interfaces—even those based on creative and unconventional designs.

---

## 🧩 What I Built

- A multi-screen BMI calculator application.
- Inspired by a minimalist design by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator).
- Clean, component-based UI with interactive user controls.
- Fully responsive and intuitive for both Android and iOS platforms.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating **multi-page apps** with `Navigator` and named routes.
- Building **custom reusable widgets** using refactoring tools in Flutter.
- Managing **state** and user input with gesture detection (`GestureDetector`).
- Theming apps using **custom color palettes** and `ThemeData`.
- Passing **functions as parameters** to dynamically update state.
- Leveraging Dart-specific concepts like:
  - `Enums` and the **Ternary Operator**
  - Differences between `const` and `final`
  - Composition over inheritance for UI development
